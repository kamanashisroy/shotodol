Shake script
============

Shake script is a file containing shake instructions. These shake instructions come in _commands_. This script can load _blocks_ of commands and execute them by interaction or by events generated by the application. The shake script files have the file extension of 'ske'. The shotodol.ske is the shake script that is loaded when program starts. The shake script is evaluated by the shake interpreter module, see [interpreter pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern).

## Shake command

Shake commands are shell like commands. The have parameters starting with *-* . You can also write a new command extending the M100Command class . There are some special commands for flow control , comparison and arithmetic operation. They are called programming commands as a whole. While there are some commands installed for basic operations like, module loading and viewing the command description. They are called the core commands. See [commands](../../core/commands/README.md)

### Programming commands

Programming features are provided by [programming instruction](../../libs/programming_instruction/) library. There are commands like *if*, *else*, *while*, *echo* and *set*. These commands let us manipulate events programmatically.

Shake variables
================

You can set variables and get their value. Suppose you want to set variable 'x' to value 9 then you need to use the `set -var x -val 9` command. Again if you want to know the value of _'x'_ then use the `echo $(x)` command to print it out.
